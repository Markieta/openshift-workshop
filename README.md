# openshift-workshop

## Initial Setup

This workshop assumes you have OpenShift installed. Either OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) or [Origin (OKD)](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md) should work. I am using Fedora 29.

Assume all commands will be run in this repository's root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Markieta/openshift-workshop.git
cd openshift-workshop/
```

## Docker Setup

[Get Docker CE for Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/).

To use Docker as non-root (recommended), see [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).

Start the Docker service with systemd:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker.service
```

Run a local Docker registry (v2):

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
```

You should now be able to see the registry's catalogue of repositories at: <http://localhost:5000/v2/_catalog>

If this is your first time creating a local Docker registry, you should see something like this:

> {"repositories":[]}

## Python Flask App

Inspect the `app.py` and `Dockerfile` in this directory that we will be pushing to our local Docker registry.

Build an image from the `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t flask-hello-world .
```

Tag it to create a repository with the full registry location:

```bash
docker tag flask-hello-world localhost:5000/flask-hello-world
```

Finally, push the new repository to the registry:

```bash
docker push localhost:5000/flask-hello-world
```

Now if you look at <http://localhost:5000/v2/_catalog> you will see this:

> {"repositories":["flask-hello-world"]}

## OpenShift Setup

Start the OpenShift cluster, this may take a few minutes:

```bash
oc cluster up
```

Create a new project to isolate this workshop environment:

```bash
$ oc new-project workshop
Now using project "workshop" on server "https://127.0.0.1:8443".
You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:
```

```bash
oc new-app centos/ruby-25-centos7~https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git
```

```bash
to build a new example application in Ruby.
```

You can always check to see which project you are currently using by running:

```bash
$ oc project
Using project "workshop" on server "https://127.0.0.1:8443".
```

Launch the Flask app in OpenShift from the Docker registry.

```bash
oc new-app localhost:5000/flask-hello-world
```

You may also do this from the OpenShift Web Console.

Review that a pod, replication controller, and service were created for this app:

```bash
$ oc get all
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/flask-hello-world-1-phxk6   1/1       Running   0          1h

NAME                                        DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
replicationcontroller/flask-hello-world-1   1         1         1         1h

NAME                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/flask-hello-world   ClusterIP   172.30.108.31   <none>        5000/TCP   1h

NAME                                                   REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/flask-hello-world   1          1         1         config
```

While the service was automatically created for us because we exposed port 5000 in the `Dockerfile`, we still need to route the service to make it accessible. Create the unsecured route:

```bash
$ oc expose service flask-hello-world
route.route.openshift.io/flask-hello-world exposed
```

See that the route was created:

```bash
$ oc get routes
NAME                HOST/PORT                                     PATH      SERVICES            PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
flask-hello-world   flask-hello-world-workshop.127.0.0.1.nip.io             flask-hello-world   5000-tcp                 None
```

The route will also be displayed in the list of all resources when running `oc get all` again.

You should now be able to access the app here: <http://flask-hello-world-workshop.127.0.0.1.nip.io/>

## OpenShift Templating

For the purpose of serializing our application, for portability or later use without all of these manual steps, we can take advantage of templates in OpenShift.

We can retrieve our resources with `oc get` and serialize them into YAML, JSON, and other output formats.

Originally you would use `oc export` to accomplish this, but in newer versions of `oc` the `Command "export" is deprecated, use the oc get --export` instead.

The syntax is as follows:

```bash
oc get <object_type> -o [ yaml | json | ... ] --export
```

### flask-hello-world template

Because the pod(s) and replication controller are automatically generated by the deployment config, we do not need to extract those resources for our template. The following command will export the deployment config, service, and route information for the `flask-hello-world` app into a single YAML config file:

```bash
oc get dc,svc,route flask-hello-world -o yaml --export > flask-hello-world.yaml
```

Here's an example of what that file might end up looking like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1

    annotations:

```

There is a lot of unnecessary information here that we can probably remove. Such as runtime/environment-specific information.

Let's test the template to ensure it works. First, delete all of the resources relating to the `flask-hello-world` app:

```bash
$ oc delete all -l app=flask-hello-world
pod "flask-hello-world-1-lbfbh" deleted
replicationcontroller "flask-hello-world-1" deleted
service "flask-hello-world" deleted
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "flask-hello-world" deleted
route.route.openshift.io "flask-hello-world" deleted
```

Ensure all resources have been deleted:

```bash
$ oc get all
No resources found.
```

Create the application with out YAML template:

```bash
$ oc create -f flask-hello-world.yaml
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/flask-hello-world created
service/flask-hello-world created
route.route.openshift.io/flask-hello-world created
```

Confirm that all of the resources were created with `oc get all` and that <http://flask-hello-world-workshop.127.0.0.1.nip.io/> is working.

### Django Template

Here is a more complex application from Software Collections on GitHub that was designed for OpenShift. Create the Django app using the GitHub source:

```bash
oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/django-ex.git
```

This may take a few seconds. You can view the status of this creating using `oc status` or from the Web Console.

After it has finished building and deploying the app (named `django-ex` by default), list all of the resources created for it:

```bash
$ oc get all -l app=django-ex
NAME                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/django-ex-1-s5glf   1/1       Running   0          19m

NAME                                DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
replicationcontroller/django-ex-1   1         1         1         19m

NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE

```

One more manual step is needed to create the route that exposes the service externally:

```bash
$ oc expose service django-ex
route.route.openshift.io/django-ex exposed
```

Visit <http://django-ex-workshop.127.0.0.1.nip.io/> and you should be greeted with:

> Welcome to your Django application on OpenShift

Because the pod(s) and replication controller are automatically generated by the deployment config, we do not need to extract those resources for our template.

The following commands will export different resource information for the `django-ex` app into separate YAML config files:

```bash
oc get dc django-ex -o yaml --export > django-ex-deploymentconfig.yaml
```

Let's delete the Django app and start from scratch to test our newly generated YAML template files:

```bash
$ oc delete all -l app=django-ex
pod "django-ex-1-mmrrs" deleted
replicationcontroller "django-ex-1" deleted
service "django-ex" deleted
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "django-ex" deleted
buildconfig.build.openshift.io "django-ex" deleted
build.build.openshift.io "django-ex-1" deleted
imagestream.image.openshift.io "django-ex" deleted
route.route.openshift.io "django-ex" deleted
```

Create the Django app using our 5 YAML files (deployment config, service, route, image stream, and build config):

```bash
$ oc create -f django-ex-deploymentconfig.yaml,django-ex-service.yaml,django-ex-route.yaml,django-ex-imagestream.yaml,django-ex-buildconfig.yaml
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/django-ex created
service/django-ex created
route.route.openshift.io/django-ex created
imagestream.image.openshift.io/django-ex created
buildconfig.build.openshift.io/django-ex created
```

Start building the new image from the existing build config:

```bash
$ oc start-build django-ex
build.build.openshift.io/django-ex-3 started
```

After a few seconds the build will complete and you should be able to access: <http://django-ex-workshop.127.0.0.1.nip.io/> as before.
